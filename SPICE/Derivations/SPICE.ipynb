    "General steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the KCL equations of the circuit at each node so that they are homogeneous - current coming into the node is negative, and current entering the node is positive.  Current always flows into the positive terminal of any circuit element.\n",
    "2. For each element, write the branch constitutive equations (BCE) in terms of the node voltages.  This amounts to using the current-voltage relations of each circuit element, combined with the current equations from step 1, to write out a system of differential equations.  At this point, also write down any trivial constant equations. \n",
    "3. Solve a linear differential algebraic equation.\n",
